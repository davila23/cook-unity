# Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + Next.js Starter

This is a lightweight starterkit / boilerplate to get up and running with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript and Next.js.

## Why make this boilerplate?

Tailwind, Next.js, and TypeScript is an excellent stack for building web apps. The most annoying part of using the stack
is setting it up every time, so I made an easy to use template that I and many others can use.

## Usage


### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install 
```

### 2. Run Development Environment

```bash
yarn dev 
```

### Test Production Environment
